// Bootloader for Digital PDP8/e PDP8/f PDP8/m computers by Roland Huisman. MIT license
// V1.1 fixed false run state message
// V1.2 changed RX(2)8 boot address for RX(2)8 (RX01/RX02) bootloader
// V1.3 Expanded to currently maximum possible 63 programs, so users can just replace the line with
// their own boot code V1.4 - Added Kaleidoscope.
//      - Removed delays and Added variable "SlowDown". So you can determine your own loading speed.
//        It's set to a quite fast but still blinky rate. Search for unsigned long SlowDown which is
//        currently set at 35 milliseconds. You can change it if you want to speed up or slow down
//        the loading. 0 gives the maximum load speed 200 gives a real slow loading.
// V1.5 Added TA8E TU60 bootstrap for Caps-8 and OS/8 setup cassettes
// V1.6 Added program 37, receive charachters on 03/04 serial port and place them into AC
// V1.7 - Updated BIN loader. You don't need to set the switches to 7777 when you want to use the
// serial port.
//        It is now permanent set to use the 'low speed reader'. Which actually means that you can
//        use the serial port at high speed.
//      - Besides the BIN loader at 03/04 there is now also a secondary BIN loader at 40/41. So if
//      you have a slow dumb terminal at
//        03/04 you can upload BIN images trough the second serial port at high speed. When you
//        start your program it wil show up on your dumb terminal or TTY.
//      - Changed the order of the bootstraps to a more logical structure
// v1.8 - fixed a word in PC04 Punch alternating 1's and 0's program
